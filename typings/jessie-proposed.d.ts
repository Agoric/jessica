// jessie-proposed.d.ts - Jessie proposed whitelist
// These are not part of the official Jessie whitelist, but are proposed
// to provide a smoother programming experience.
//
// When they have become a part of:
// https://github.com/Agoric/Jessie/blob/master/src/bundle/whitelist.js
// then they will be moved to lib.jessie.d.ts.
